# JobTracker AWS

☁️ JobTracker AWS is a personal cloud-native project designed to track job applications through a lightweight and scalable web application. The goal is to demonstrate practical experience in modern cloud architecture and DevOps best practices using AWS serverless technologies.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world, production-grade cloud-native application with a clear technical and functional scope. It was built to showcase cloud solution design, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and modern CI/CD practices, while also solving a personal need: managing job applications efficiently.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- REST API for job application tracking (CRUD)
- Serverless backend using AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- Data stored in DynamoDB (NoSQL)
- Secure endpoints (API key or Cognito-based auth)
- Infrastructure managed via Terraform
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Logging and monitoring with CloudWatch

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology        |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Backend          | AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway |
| Database         | DynamoDB          |
| Authentication   | Cognito at the end (but simple API key for MVP) |
| Infrastructure   | Terraform         |
| CI/CD            | GitHub Actions    |
| Monitoring       | CloudWatch Logs & Alarms |
| Frontend         | React + S3 + CloudFront |
| Bonus Features   | AWS SES, S3 file upload |

---

## 📐 Architecture

The application follows a modular, serverless architecture deployed entirely on AWS.  
A basic version includes:

[User] --> [API Gateway] --> [Lambda Functions] --> [DynamoDB]

More advanced components will include:

- Cognito for user authentication
- GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD
- CloudWatch alarms and dashboards
- S3 static frontend hosting

Detailed architecture diagrams are available in the `/diagrams` folder.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

> This project is currently in early development. The infrastructure setup and initial API endpoints will be released soon.

Planned modules:

1. **Infrastructure setup**: Terraform configuration for AWS resources
2. **API implementation**: Python-based Lambda functions for job application CRUD
3. **CI/CD integration**: Automated deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions
4. **Authentication**: Cognito user pool setup or basic API key usage
5. **Frontend / Demo**: static React frontend

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Designing and documenting scalable cloud architectures
- Applying security best practices (IAM roles, access policies)
- Automating infrastructure with Terraform
- Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Using monitoring/logging tools (CloudWatch)
- Clear and structured technical communication
